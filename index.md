## Act I ##

    ## Chapter 1 ##

        ### 1. **Opening Image - Artist or fraud?** ###
        
            Marina stares at a painting of a meadow with a cheery round sun casting beams through broad oaks.  The painting is hung against the wall between the mens and ladies bathrooms in the foyer of Starview Resort.  She stares at it more.  The strokes are right, the lines the form, but it is so lifeless and strange, like a movie or a VR game.  Her signature is at the bottom, along with a little plaque which reads "Starview amateur artist contest, Summer 2106".  She hasn't painted since then, now it is only 12 days until 2110.  Why does she even call herself an artist?

        ### 2. **Theme Stated - Woman in Red** ###
        
            Her staring is interrupted by a richly dressed older woman in a red dress leaving the bathroom.  Looking at the painting, the woman says, "The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls. --Pablo Picasso"  Marina counters with her own quote "People around here don't stand in art galleries, they get things done.  --My dad."  They continue a conversation about how art is work and how art can be outside of galleries."  The asks Marina her surname and figures out she is the painter.  Marina is embarrassed.  In blunt-old-person fashion, the woman says, "Your art.  It looks like Earth, but it doesn't have the soul of Earth."  She smiles and walks away leaving Marina wondering.

        ### 3. **Setup - A view of her world** ###
        
            Marina begins her work at the hotel.  She's a housekeeper.  Her next door neighbor Cora, a mother of three, helped her get the job.  She's grateful but unfulfilled.  She likes to look out the windows of the tall hotel and take in nearly half of the 32km long station, the rest fades into the light of the linear sun, a long full spectrum lamp which runs the length of the station.  Beneath the sounds of the busy resort there is a constant gentle rhythm as the station rotates generating gravity.  This is her home, she's lived here all her life, but **she wonders if it is really where she belongs**.

    ## Chapter 2 ##

        ### 1. **Setup - Meeting Voyager** ###
        
            After work she decides to take a walk through Spectra Gamma, a virtual reality promenade at the edge of the resort, before heading home.  She stops and is drawn into listening to a local musician dressed in a tailored outfit playing popular Earth tunes on a beautiful violin.  She wishes he was real.  Her focus is broken by a stranger asking her if she knows who that is.  She says no and when he begins to tell her she huffs cutting him off telling him she doesn't really care who it is.  He rolls with it and introduces himself.  It's Voyager.  She just walks away feeling vulnerable and annoyed that a stranger would bug her.  Later that night she has dinner with her mom.  Her mom wonders if it was her elementary school friend and that not many people have a name like that.  Marina had forgotten about him, but says that he wasn't her friend as he would always tease her about her hair on the playground and that he was too scrawny to be this guy.

        ### 2. **Setup - Marina and Emmi at the Art Gallery** ###
        
            The next day is Saturday and Marina meets up with her friend Emmi in Montegaulle.  They visit an art gallery there.  All the art is from Earth.  Marina asks if they ever hold exhibits for local artists, but the curator says he's never met an artist from Vesta.  She tells him she is a painter.  He smirks and responds that the gallery is very selective about its exhibits, and with a backhanded compliment wishes her luck.  Marina and Emmi leave with Emmi trying to cheer Marina up.

        ### 3. **Catalyst - Marina gets fired** ###
        
            Marina gets fired from her job as a housekeeper.  She had lost track of time while looking out the window and was rushing to get her assigned rooms finished when she took a corner too quickly and toppled her cleaning cart into a pretty important hotel guest.  The guest tells the front desk and she ends up being scolded, fired, and told she will never work in Starview again.  She knows how difficult it is to find a job on the station that isn't in the mines, and she feels like she really screwed up.

    ## Chapter 3 ##

        ### 1. **B Story - Voyager overhears some bad news** ###
        
            The station's mining operations have been slowly digging to the center of Vesta for nearly a century now.  Mining the olivine rich mantle of the asteroid has been providing fairly stable income for the station as a whole, but the real payoff is the supposed iron-nickel rich core which can be mined for deep space construction.  Voyager tags along while a co-worker in the ore classification department is asked to deliver the bad news that the mines have now passed the depth where the core should start and there is still only olivine, no signs of iron-nickel.  The investors are upset and say if they don't reach the core in another five years they will need to cut their losses, shut the mines down, and sell off the tourist part of the station, the only valuable part.  This of course means that AsterX will shutdown and miners like Voyager and Marina's dad will be laid off or shuffled to another part of the asteroid belt to work. 

        ### 2. **Debate - Errand to AsterX** ###
        
            Marina is without work and worrying what she is going to do with her life.  Will she find more work on Vesta?  Will she need to leave the station and her family?  She has her paints out but has been staring at a blank canvas all day.  She tries working to finish one of her existing pieces, but the woman in red's comments flood her mind.  The woman is right, her art is flat and dimensionless, and has no soul.  She cries in frustration.  She goes and talks with her mom about it.  Her mom says maybe she needs a break and asks her run an errand to AsterX to bring her father an item he forgot.  And maybe she can ask about work there.

        ### 3. **Debate - Interview at AsterX** ###

        ### 2. **Choosing Act Two** ###
        
            Marina chooses to be a painter and that her art should be in the Montegaulle art gallery.  She has a new drive to paint!  She is a bit out of practice though and decides to work abstractly on forms and lines until she can find the soul of her art.  She has a really good morning of painting practice and decides to go out to find inspiration.  After wandering the city for a while she finds herself in Spectra Gamma watching and listening to virtual musician again.  She turns to find Voyager there again and they talk.  She apologizes for forgetting who he was.  He notices that she is much more spirited than the last time they met and asks what she is doing today.  She says she's looking for inspiration.

        ### 3. **B Story - Surprise date with Voyager** ###
        
            "I know just the place!", Voyager says with a smile, "Let me take you there."  "For coffee?"  "We can catch up."  She is a  little surprised but warming up to his charm, she asks "When?"  "Right now, before dark." he says mysteriously.  She agrees thinking that maybe adding something random to her life might stir up the muse.  And indeed it does as during this impromptu date, in a bistro overlooking the calm waters of Lake Asimov, with the vibrant colors of Calico Farms hovering above their heads following the station's cylindrical curve, she realizes that the soul of her art is right here, her home, Vesta.  From now on, she will paint Vesta.

The curator apologizes but says they would be happy to show her art later in the year at another event.  Marina looks up between the Jade towers and the lights of the central business district towards Starview to see the station breached by what looks like flaming streaks of light.  Meteor after meteor slamming into the sides of buildings catching them on fire.

        ### 1. **Devastation - Oh the humanity** ###
        
            The station breach alarms slowly rising and falling flood her mind with elementary school drill memories as she stands at the south end of Central Garden, frozen at the sight of her world repeatedly being torn apart.  One meteor lands at the other end of the park in front of her igniting trees and bushes in its vicinity.  She grabs her painting from the easel and turns to run across the street, into the New Hope Bazaar as another glowing rock flies overhead, ricochets off the sturdily built linear sun then plows into AsterX HQ.  A wind picks up as the atmosphere of the station is now steadily being evacuated into the void of space.  She makes it safely inside the multiple square kilometer bazaar.  She keeps running towards Housington as other survivors stare out windows with shock and horror.
